# React/web naming conventions

Apply these primary naming conventions for React/web files:

| Element | Convention | Example | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Component files | `PascalCase` | `UserProfile.tsx` | Aligns with component names in JSX (`<UserProfile />`) and distinguishes components from non-component files. |
| Non-component files | `kebab-case` or `camelCase` | `format-date.ts` or `formatDate.ts` | Aligns with standard JavaScript function and variable naming conventions. |
| Folders | `kebab-case` | `user-profile/` | Improves readability and avoids cross-platform case-sensitivity issues. |
| Custom hooks | `camelCase` prefixed with `use` | `useAuth.ts` | Matches React hook rules and makes hooks easy to identify. |

## Enforcement guidance

- Use `PascalCase` only for files that export React components as the primary module content.
- Do not place component files in `kebab-case` or `snake_case`.
- Keep hook filenames prefixed with `use` and colocate them near the feature folder when possible.
