# Planning Start Here

## Current Baseline
- Baseline branch: `main`
- Deployable scope baseline: Phase 2 core features
- Advanced branch status: `phase-3-advanced-features` is parked/deferred and not baseline for deploy

## Active Plan
- Primary execution plan: `.planning/in_progress/phase-2.5-core-hardening.md`
- Goal: stabilize and polish the core user journey before reintroducing advanced features

## Supporting Docs
- UI libraries and mockup research: `.planning/research/ui-component-and-mockup-options.md`
- Core/UI decision log: `.planning/research/decision-log-core-ui.md`
- Main roadmap: `.planning/PLAN.md`

## Agent Preflight Checklist
1. Read `.planning/in_progress/phase-2.5-core-hardening.md` fully.
2. Confirm branch baseline is `main` before implementation.
3. Treat advanced Phase 3 scope as deferred unless explicitly approved for reintroduction.
4. Review `.planning/research/decision-log-core-ui.md` for locked decisions and revisit triggers.
5. Update planning artifacts in the same branch as implementation changes.
