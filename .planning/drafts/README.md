# Phase plan drafts

Each file in this folder is a detailed plan for one phase from [../PLAN.md](../PLAN.md).

**Workflow:**
1. Review the draft for the phase you are about to start.
2. Move the draft file to [../in_progress/](../in_progress/) when you begin the phase.
3. In the moved file, use the "In progress" section to log achievements, decisions, and roadblocks.
4. When the phase is complete, you can archive or move the file as you prefer.

**Naming:** `phase-0N-short-name.md` (e.g. `phase-01-foundation.md`).
