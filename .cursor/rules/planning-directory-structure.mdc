# Planning directory structure

- **All planning** goes into the `.planning` directory.
- **All research files** go inside `.planning/research/` (a `research` directory inside the planning folder).

When creating or moving planning docs, research, or phase drafts, use this structure. Check planning progress and limitations in `.planning/` before making changes.
